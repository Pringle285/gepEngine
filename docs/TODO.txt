TODO: 

UML:
Some areas will need smaller versions of almost the same diagram, for example
when talking about the rendering system in the engine it would be worth having a smaller UML
diagram to only show the rendering system
Also when only talking about the resource handling it would be worth having a 
small UML only displaying the resource handling section of the engine

Remember to add a vector/list of cameras in core and link the camera class through
aggregation on the UML back to the list held in core. 


CODE:
Add the keyboard functionality, once this is done check the UML info is correct in 
Core keyboard pointer
Component Keyboard pointer
And fill out the Keyboard class on the UML diagram
